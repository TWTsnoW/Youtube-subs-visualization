# To run the code:
  You can implement the GenMap.js in our website, or if you wants just to test and see your results, you can use a local server looks like   WAMP, XAMPP or LAMP.
  You need too, csv files with your subscribers data, you can find in your Youtube's Dashboard. (I put two sample files)
  
Good tests and learning !!
