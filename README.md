# To run the code:
  You can implement the GenMap.js in our website, or if you wants just to test and see your results, you can use a local server looks like   WAMP, XAMPP or LAMP.<br />
  You need too, csv files with your subscribers data, you can find in your Youtube's Dashboard. (I put two sample files)<br />
  
Good tests and learning !!
